# Device-management-application---Spring-ReactJS-Docker
  The device management application is a great way for users to keep track of their devices and monitor their energy consumption.
  It allows the users to chat with admin & other users for help, view their devices, and view a chart showing their device's energy consumption over a chosen period of time.
An admin can chat with users and help them, manage all devices & users, and create mapping relationships between users & devices.
It uses microservices in order to have good management over the servers, and all is deployed on Docker.
